                    <h3>How Does The Internet Work?</h3>
                    <p>The internet is a vast network that connects millions of devices worldwide, allowing them to share information. It functions through a set of protocols, infrastructure, and technologies that facilitate communication between computers, servers, and other devices. The internet is not a single entity but a network of interconnected systems that work together to transmit data.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>What is HTTP?</strong> HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for transferring data over the web. It enables browsers to request web pages from servers. When you type a URL in the address bar, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server where the website is hosted. The server then sends back the requested page, which the browser displays to you. HTTP operates over a request-response model and is stateless, meaning each request is independent of others. The more secure version, HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), uses encryption to protect the data exchanged between the browser and the server.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>What is a Domain Name?</strong> A domain name is a human-readable address that is used to identify a website on the internet. For example, "www.example.com" is a domain name. Domain names are easier to remember than numeric IP addresses, which are used to identify computers. When you type a domain name into the browser, the Domain Name System (DNS) translates it into an IP address that the computer can use to find the server hosting the website. Domain names are registered through domain registrars and are associated with specific IP addresses to route internet traffic properly.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>What is Hosting?</strong> Web hosting refers to the service that stores websites and makes them accessible over the internet. A hosting provider offers the physical infrastructure (servers), software, and services that allow websites to be viewed by users. When you create a website, its files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) are uploaded to a server that is connected to the internet. Web hosting services vary in their offerings, such as shared hosting, dedicated hosting, cloud hosting, and virtual private servers (VPS), which differ in performance, security, and pricing.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>DNS and How it Works?</strong> DNS (Domain Name System) is like a phone book for the internet. It translates domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. When a user enters a domain name in a browser, a DNS query is sent to a DNS server, which looks up the corresponding IP address. Once the browser receives the IP address, it can connect to the appropriate server. DNS allows users to access websites using easy-to-remember domain names instead of having to remember the numerical IP addresses of servers.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Browsers and How They Work</strong> A web browser is a software application used to access and display websites. Browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to render webpages. When you enter a URL in the browser’s address bar, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server where the website is hosted. Once the response is received, the browser renders the content, including text, images, and interactive elements, on the screen. Browsers also manage session data, such as cookies, and enable features like tabbed browsing and bookmarking for a better user experience.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Additional Information</h4>
                    <p>In addition to the core concepts mentioned above, the internet relies on several other technologies and protocols to ensure that data is transmitted efficiently and securely:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>IP Addresses:</strong> An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to every device connected to the internet. It ensures that data can be routed to the correct destination.</li>
                        <li><strong>TCP/IP Protocol:</strong> TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a set of rules that govern how data is transmitted over the internet. It breaks data into packets and ensures they are delivered in the correct order.</li>
                        <li><strong>CDNs (Content Delivery Networks):</strong> CDNs are networks of servers distributed across different locations that store copies of web content. They help speed up the delivery of content to users by serving it from a server that is geographically closer to them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Web Servers:</strong> Web servers are software and hardware that store and serve web pages. Popular web server software includes Apache and Nginx, which handle incoming HTTP requests and send the appropriate responses back to the client.</li>
                        <li><strong>SSL/TLS:</strong> SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols used to secure communication between a browser and a server. Websites that use HTTPS implement SSL/TLS to encrypt data, protecting it from being intercepted by attackers.</li>

                    <h3>HTML Education</h3>
                    <p>HTML is the fundamental markup language used to create web pages. Below are some key concepts and uses of HTML:</p>
                    
                    <h4>Basic HTML Questions</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>What is HTML? What does it do?</strong> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the markup language used to structure content on web pages. It tells the browser how to display text, images, and other content.</li>
                        <li><strong>What are the differences between HTML5 and previous versions of HTML?</strong> HTML5 introduces new features like semantic tags (e.g., &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;), multimedia support (video and audio tags), and improved support for mobile devices.</li>
                        <li><strong>What is the difference between &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags in HTML?</strong> The &lt;head&gt; tag contains metadata for the document (such as title, character encoding, and links to CSS files), while the &lt;body&gt; tag contains the actual content of the page that is visible to users.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Tags and Structure</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>What is the basic structure of an HTML page?</strong> A basic HTML page typically contains the &lt;html&gt; element (the root), the &lt;head&gt; element (for metadata), and the &lt;body&gt; element (for visible content). Within the body, you may find elements like &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>What is the purpose of semantic HTML tags?</strong> Semantic HTML tags provide meaning to the content they enclose, improving both accessibility and SEO. For example, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and &lt;article&gt; help search engines and assistive technologies understand the structure of a webpage better.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Commonly Used HTML Tags</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>&lt;a&gt; (Anchor) tag:</strong> Used to create hyperlinks to other web pages or external resources. It is commonly used for navigation.</li>
                        <li><strong>&lt;img&gt; (Image) tag:</strong> Used to display images on a webpage. The &lt;img&gt; tag includes the src attribute (for the image source) and alt attribute (for a text description of the image).</li>
                        <li><strong>&lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; (Unordered and Ordered List) tags:</strong> Used to create lists of items. &lt;ul&gt; creates an unordered list, while &lt;ol&gt; creates an ordered (numbered) list.</li>
                        <li><strong>&lt;form&gt; tag:</strong> Used to collect user input. The &lt;form&gt; tag typically includes various input elements such as &lt;input&gt;, &lt;textarea&gt;, and &lt;button&gt;.</li>
                    </ul>
